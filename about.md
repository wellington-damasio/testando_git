## About
This is just some markdown I wrote on GitHub

### Nvim
I am really considering learning nvim to be able to work at least 90% of the time on the terminal.

I think  tmux + nvim + git app + fish terminal would be a great workflow

Some window tiling software would be good too...

With LunaVim I would be able to write code, install packages, manage GitHub repositories and operate server and backend apps in the same place

### Lil tired
I think I need to rest... But I'm enjoying learning git and some terminal commands
